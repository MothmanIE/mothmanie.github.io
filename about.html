						<h2> About this Project </h2>
						<p>This project was created as an assignment project for EGM715: Web Based GIS. The project involved utilising OpenLayers to create a Irish counties quiz with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The OpenLayers Vector layer was created with vector data from both OSI and OSNI, which were merged and reprojected to EPSG:4326. OpenLayers documentation and examples were adapted from giserdgy.com and JavaScript documentation was obtained from w3schools and developers.mozilla.org.</p>
						<p>Programming map interactions proved to be the greatest challenge for this assignment. JavaScript proved to be a tough, but fair obstacle and coming out of this I feel I have only scratched the surface of its capabilities, but I can see a whole world of powerful interactions that it is capable of. The short timeframe under which this project was produced somewhat limited my ability to develop features, and given more time there are a number of things I would like to add.</p>
						<p>First and Foremost I would alter the code for question generation to ensure that counties would not repeat during the quiz. Having the same county repeat itself multiple times in the quiz can prove confusing and somewhat irritating, and I would like to remove it.</p>
						<p>Secondly, the geoJSON vector file includes information for the Irish names for each county; I would have liked to implement a way to choose an irish language version of the quiz or an english language version. I would also have implemented the choice of 15 or 32 questions.</p>

						<h2>Author</h2>
						<p>My name is Jack Campbell, I am currently studying environmental GIS under Ulster University at a PgDip level. While my previous experience with programming is limited, I have found through this project that it is something I can enjoy in its ability to challenge and entertain me. I am looking forward to developing these skills further and seeing what new projects I am capable of.</p>
